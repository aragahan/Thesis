Title: A Machine Learning Based Web Application Focused on Predicting the Risk of Diabetes Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

- Aims to create a web application to be used as a decision support tool for patients at risk of diabetes
- Utilizes Python as the main programming language
- Primary libraries used are Sci-kit learn, pyplot, seaborn, Numpy
- XAI libraries used are SHAP and LIME
- Best performing model was the Random Forest with SMOTE model, with an AUROC of 0.9828 and nearly perfect Precision, Recall, and F1 scores
- Web application was built under the Django framework and Bootstrap library and integrated with LIME for the XAI


##
## Homepage
- Contains the title and description of the application as well as the instructions on how to use the app
- Users are required to input different vital signs and body features
- Users also have the option to upload a CSV file instead of manually entering inputs
